        Since the early descriptions of Swartout et al. [19] and Young [26], most Interactive
Storytelling systems have integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, which
generate narrative actions sequences, with 3D graphics and animations, staging these
narrative actions to produce the actual interactive story. However, AI formalisms can
only succeed with appropriate processes for knowledge acquisition. When investigat-
ing which domain knowledge could best support the IS endeavour, most researchers
turned to narratology as the main discipline that could support narrative analysis and
formalisation.
In this paper, we review the main narrative theories that have inspired IS research
and provide a critical insight into how these theories can support further develop-
ments of our discipline 1. One key question here would be to which extent narrative
formalisms facilitate computational description [25]; as we shall see, many IS re-
searchers have already embraced them with some success, although much remains to
be done to take full benefit of these theories. Our goal is not to judge on the appropri-
ateness of past use of narrative theories by IS colleagues; rather, it is to provide a
perspective and some critical comments, which hopefully should prove helpful when
considering the use of narratology to support research in IS.

Aristotle provided the earliest analysis of what (throughout later centuries) became
known as traditional drama, insisting in particular on its progression through climax
and the final resolution (denouement). It is the strength of the classical model to have
imposed itself virtually unchallenged almost until the 20 th century, and as such its
descriptive power has been considerable. This has led IS researchers such as Mateas,
in his early work [15], to subscribe to a neo-aristetolian vision of Interactive Drama
(also following [12]). However, Mateas acutely identified the lack of emphasis on
agency as a limitation of the Aristotelian model, and consequently proposed an exten-
sion to the Aristotelian model precisely incorporating user interaction. Although Aris-
totle’s Poetics is often cited in IS work for its description of narrative evolution (see
e.g. “narrative arcs” in [27]), only Tomaszewski and Binsted [22] have proposed an
IS model based on its principles.
To which extent can Aristotelian theory assist in the development of IS systems?
As its discussion in previous IS work suggests, it does provide a model for story pro-
gression that encompasses important aesthetic properties of the story. Aristotle also
introduced the important concept of proairesis (or “deliberate choice”, which we will
see developed in Barthes’ work) as a central aspect of narratives. On the other hand,
the Aristotelian model’s descriptive power is not sufficient to be considered as a nar-
rative formalism sui generis. The main reason is that it does not include a fine-grained
description, or even a proper formalisation, of narrative actions. In IS, the Aristotelian
model seems to have been primarily used as an inspiration, a theoretical framework in
which to describe narrative concepts, rather than a source of narrative formalisms, let
alone their implementations in IS systems.
